My focus this week is mostly setting up (and in some cases creating) tooling to help me with my:

- Note taking (learn)
- Script/module authoring (play)
- Blog/journal writing (grow)

I suddenly have much more time on my hands than I ever remember having before. While most of it will certainly be used to ***learn, play, and grow***. I will also be putting effort into completing (or at least further developing) various projects I have started over the years.

As part of my whole ***learn, play, and grow*** thing I am in the process of forking projects that I want to learn from. Wherever possible please work from (and contribute to) the original instead of my fork.
