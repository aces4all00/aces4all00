I am an IT Automator, Problem Solver, Solution Builder, and Advisor with strong focuses on Operations and DevOps. Much of this past year has been filled with kearning new ways to live my life after losing most of my vision, including how to continue to do the work I enjoy so much.

This site is a way for me to showcase and share the work I am doing now as well as to give voice to some of my current challenges as I continue to adjust to the new challenges Life has laid before me.

Thank you all and have a great day,
